// This protocol defines annotations on GA4GH genomic sequences It includes two
// types of annotations: continuous and discrete hierarchical.
//
// The discrete hierarchical annotations (called Features) are derived from 
// the Sequence Ontology (SO) and GFF3 work
//
//    http://www.sequenceontology.org/gff3.shtml
//
// The goal is to be able to store annotations using the GFF3 and SO conceptual
// model, although there is not necessarly a one-to-one mapping in Protobuf 
// messages to GFF3 records.
//
// The minimum requirement is to be able to accurately represent the current
// state of the art annotation data and the full SO model.  Feature is the
// core generic record which corresponds to the a GFF3 record.
//
// The continuous data (called Continuous) represents numerical data
// associated with each base position, such as is stored in BigWig, Wiggle
// or BedGraph Formats
