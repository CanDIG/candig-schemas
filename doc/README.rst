!!!!!!!!!!!

This directory contains source and tools to build the CanDIG schemas

Read the Docs, typically within two minutes of a commit to the master
branch.


Building

Then to build documentation, type::

  make docs

the ``target/doc/html`` directory.  (You will need certain
prerequisites and, for the moment, you'll have to ferret those out
yourself.)
